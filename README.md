# Telemetry-driven-predictive-maintenance-system-for-UAVs-using-machine-learning-
This work presents an LSTM-based predictive maintenance system for UAVs using real-time multi-sensor telemetry such as IMU, GPS, roll, pitch and yaw data to detect anomalies, predict future states, and support early fault identification, improving UAV reliability, safety, and operational readiness.
